# LZW_DataCompression
The LZW algorithm is a very common compression technique. 
This algorithm is typically used in GIF and optionally in PDF and TIFF. Unix’s ‘compress’ command, among other uses. It is lossless, meaning no data is lost when compressing. The algorithm is simple to implement and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations. It is the algorithm of the widely used Unix file compression utility compress and is used in the GIF image format. The Idea relies on reoccurring patterns to save data space. LZW is the foremost technique for general-purpose data compression due to its simplicity and versatility. It is the basis of many PC utilities that claim to “double the capacity of your hard drive”.
